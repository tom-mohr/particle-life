# ðŸ¦  Particle Life Framework

A Java framework that can simulate a variety of particle systems. It uses space partitioning and parallelization to achieve a significant speedup.

It can be configured to use the rules of Particle Life, a particle system showing life-like behaviour.

Check out [this app](https://particle-life.com) to see this framework in action.

## Usage

See the [documentation](https://particle-life.com/java-framework/overview.html) for an explanation of how to add this as a dependency to your project and how to get the physics simulation up and running.
